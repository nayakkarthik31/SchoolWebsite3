The large and well-ventilated Cafeteria seats the entire school in three batches. Children are served wholesome, freshly cooked, tasty dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, with a varied menu so that different palates are satisfied. The food is hygienically prepared in the kitchen attached to the dining hall. Children have breakfast and lunch as well as a mid-morning health drink and a post-school snack and juice. Children not on the Meal Plan also eat in the cafeteria.</p>

And they learn so much: finding solutions for everyday problems through design thinking; acquiring technical skills and strategic thinking; making mistakes and dealing with the fallout, both practical and emotional; trying things a hundred different ways; using tools from corrugated cardboard for prototypes to software for 3D modeling and much more. And through it all, the focus is the discovery and making process to nurture the inventors of the future.</p>
